## The Elephant in the Room

First an introduction, for those who've never heard of me, I'm Frank. Chris and I are your co-presidents and we work for you to create fun events, provide leadership to our event organizers, and make sure you're having a good time.

Now, this last year has been difficult. We were faced with having to navigate a confusing, scary, never-before-faced (for us) landscape where we had to juggle risk and choice with health and safety. For me, that meant severely constricting my social groups to protect myself and loved ones and living life online. I imagine it wasn't as easy for any of you. But, hark, for the end is in sight! The CDC and other public health officials have released new guidelines indicating that vaccinated persons are *less than 0.1% likely* to spread SARS-CoV-2 and/or suffer severe illness. That means as more Minnesotans are getting vaccinated and overall pandemic statistics like postive test rates and cases fall, the pandemic is starting to break. I applaud those who took this seriously, followed public health advice, and got vaccinated. For without you, we wouldn't be at this stage. I also want to acknowledge all the healthcare personnel, frontline workers, and other folks who were on the knife's edge of this pandemic. I know this took a toll on you, and I am grateful for your service.

As we kickoff the new season, we at Nerdvana will be maintaining a hands-off approach with respect to vaccination status as that is a private healthcare matter. However, we strongly recommend that anyone attending a Nerdvana event be vaccinated for your own protection. Furthermore, in keeping with the [Nerdvana Code of Ethics](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AlRdue6dio3ykfEpDxM_keFMRqTTng?e=AfWtqZ), I must remind all Nerdvanites to adhere to federal, state, local laws, and posted requirements while at Nerdvana events.

As we all venture into the sun (so bright!) again, we at Nerdvana are excited to share it with you!

## A Round of Applause
I'd like to take another minute and thank Chris, Claire, Erica, and others who have run online and small group-type events over the last year! Over the past year, we've seen online gaming events like Among Us, JackBox, Tabletop Simulator sessions, D&D, and a few outdoor events. Thank you soo much!

## Nerdvana 3.0
Now to new business! Over this past year, I have been thinking about Nerdvana and what has worked (and what doesn't). As a result, I will be making a few changes to the structure and communication plan of Nerdvana which I will detail below and in another post.

1. I've decided to start issuing quarterly newsletters and occasional blog posts which will be hosted on the [Nerdvana Blog](https://blog.nerdvanasocial.club). These newsletters will be your main source of information about NSC, what the executive team is working on, where we're going, and how we're gonna bring our community along.

1. Due to Facebook's complicity in the Capitol insurrection, I cannot and will not back that platform. Regardless, Facebook Messenger was ill-suited to running an organization at any true scale. Therefore, all command channels will shift to Slack [https://nerdvana-social-club.slack.com] or Signal. For on-the-ground event support, we'll use Meetup's messaging platform. If you curious about leadership or want to plunk around on our Slack, feel free to email or message me and I'll shoot you an invite!

1. In our previous iteration, I feel like we lost sight of our North star: collaborating on topics which move our community forward and creating slates of events. As a result, I will be instituting a quarterly meeting where leadership and membership can get together to discuss the current state of Nerdvana, where we wish to go, and how we'll get there. We'll also use that meeting to meet prospective event organizers.

1. I'm taking applications for leadership positions including the [Vice President of Membership](docs/posiitons/vp-membership.md) and [VP of Public Relations](docs/positions/vp-public-relations.md). These will be members of the executive committee along with Chris and I. The VP, Membership is a position oriented around keeping our members happy and gathering feedback from the membership. The VP, Public Relations would be in charge of promoting events, converting casual event-goers into members, and promoting the group.

## Donations
Finally, this is a community-driven and community-funded organization. Chris and I fund the Meetup dues which amount to about $200 a year out of pocket. If you feel we provide a good service, feel free to PayPal donations to [@fmadridii](https://paypal.me/fmadridii?locale.x=en_US)
